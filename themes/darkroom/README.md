# Darkroom Theme

A dark, photography-focused theme for bckt that emphasizes visual content with minimal distractions.

## Features

- **Dark aesthetic**: Inspired by traditional darkrooms with a black background
- **Photo-first design**: Large, prominent images with subtle metadata
- **Gallery grid**: Responsive photo grid on the index page
- **Minimal UI**: Clean interface that doesn't distract from the photography
- **EXIF data display**: Shows camera, lens, and shooting settings for photo posts
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Lazy loading**: Images load as needed for better performance

## Post Types

### Photo Posts (type: photo)

Photo posts get special treatment with:
- Full-width photo display
- EXIF metadata display (camera, lens, aperture, exposure, focal length, ISO)
- Grid thumbnail view on index and archive pages
- Overlay with title and date on hover

### Standard Posts

Non-photo posts are displayed with a traditional blog layout.

## EXIF Data

The theme automatically displays EXIF data from the frontmatter:

- `camera`: Camera model
- `lens`: Lens model
- `aperture_friendly`: F-stop (e.g., f/1.6)
- `exposure_friendly`: Shutter speed (e.g., 1/63s)
- `focal_length_friendly`: Focal length (e.g., 4.2mm)
- `iso`: ISO value

These fields are automatically generated by `bckt-photo` when processing images.

## Color Scheme

- Background: `#0a0a0a` (dark gray)
- Darker areas: `#000000` (pure black)
