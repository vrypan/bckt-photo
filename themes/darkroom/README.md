# Darkroom Theme

A dark, photography-focused theme for bckt that emphasizes visual content with minimal distractions.

## Features

- **Dark aesthetic**: Inspired by traditional darkrooms with a black background
- **Photo-first design**: Large, prominent images with subtle metadata
- **Gallery grid**: Responsive photo grid on the index page
- **Minimal UI**: Clean interface that doesn't distract from the photography
- **EXIF data display**: Shows camera, lens, and shooting settings for photo posts
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Lazy loading**: Images load as needed for better performance

## Post Types

### Photo Posts (type: photo)

Photo posts get special treatment with:
- Full-width photo display
- EXIF metadata display (camera, lens, aperture, exposure, focal length, ISO)
- Grid thumbnail view on index and archive pages
- Overlay with title and date on hover

### Standard Posts

Non-photo posts are displayed with a traditional blog layout.

## EXIF Data

The theme automatically displays EXIF data from the frontmatter:

- `camera`: Camera model
- `lens`: Lens model
- `aperture_friendly`: F-stop (e.g., f/1.6)
- `exposure_friendly`: Shutter speed (e.g., 1/63s)
- `focal_length_friendly`: Focal length (e.g., 4.2mm)
- `iso`: ISO value

These fields are automatically generated by `bckt-photo` when processing images.

## Color Scheme

- Background: `#0a0a0a` (dark gray)
- Darker areas: `#000000` (pure black)
- Primary text: `#e0e0e0` (light gray)
- Secondary text: `#999999` (medium gray)
- Muted text: `#666666` (dark gray)
- Accent: `#ffffff` (white)
- Borders: `#222222` (very dark gray)

## Layout

- **Index page**: Photo grid with 3 columns on desktop, responsive to 1 column on mobile
- **Photo posts**: Full-width image with metadata below
- **Archive pages**: Same grid layout as index
- **Tag pages**: Same grid layout as index

## Requirements

- bckt >= 0.4.2

## Usage

1. Install the theme
```
bckt themes download --github vrypan/bckt-photo/themes darkroom
```
2. Enable the theme
```
bckt themes use darkroom
```
3. Configure search (see below)
4. Build your site with `bckt build`

## Search Configuration

The Darkroom theme includes enhanced search functionality that displays photo metadata in search results. To enable this, you need to configure `payload_fields` in your `bckt.yaml` (see also bckt.yaml.example):

```yaml
search:
  asset_path: assets/search/search-index.json
  default_language: en
  payload_fields:
    - image
    - camera
    - make
    - iso
    - aperture_friendly
    - exposure_friendly
    - focal_length_friendly
  languages:
    - id: en
      name: English
      stopwords:
        - a
        - an
        - the
        # ... add your stopwords
```

### Payload Fields

The `payload_fields` configuration tells bckt which frontmatter fields to include in the search index. This allows the theme to display:

- **image**: Photo filename for display in search results
- **camera**: Camera model (e.g., "iPhone 12 mini")
- **make**: Camera manufacturer (e.g., "Apple")
- **iso**: ISO value (e.g., "125")
- **aperture_friendly**: User-friendly aperture (e.g., "f/1.6")
- **exposure_friendly**: User-friendly shutter speed (e.g., "1/63s")
- **focal_length_friendly**: User-friendly focal length (e.g., "4.2mm")

These fields are automatically generated by `bckt-photo` when processing images with EXIF data.

**Note**: A sample `bckt.yaml` file is included in the theme directory as a reference.

## Customization

To customize the theme:

- Edit `templates/style.css` to modify colors and layout
- Edit template files in `templates/` to change structure
- CSS variables are defined at the top of `style.css` for easy color changes
